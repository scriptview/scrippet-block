This plugin adds a block to the Gutenberg editor to render HTML Fountain-formatted screenplay snippets.

== Description ==

**Scrippet Block** enables users to write screenplay content using Markdown in Fountain syntax directly within the WordPress block editor.
This plugin automatically converts the entered text into a properly formatted HTML page, adhering to industry standards for screenplays.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Fountain syntax? =

Fountain is a simple markup language designed for writing screenplays in plain text.
It allows writers to create properly formatted screenplays without the need for specialized software.
Scrippet leverages this syntax to make screenplay formatting easy and accessible within WordPress.

Search for "Scrippet" in the block library, and click on it to insert it into your post or page.
You can then start writing your screenplay using Fountain syntax within the block, and the preview will render in real-time beneath the editor.
